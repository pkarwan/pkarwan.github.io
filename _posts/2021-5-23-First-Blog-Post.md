What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and statistical methods (behind the scene) to find trends and manage data. Data scientists closely follow the “data science process” that is more approachable; data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. Data Scientist helps to understand the business based on data analysis and this helps companies to gain more profit , cost cutting/investments where ever necessary and run company/business more efficiently. A data scientist’s work typically involves making sense of messy, unstructured data, from multiple types of sources. They understand data from a business point of view and can provide accurate predictions and insights that can be used to power critical business decisions.
Since data scientists focus on analyzing data, providing business insights, and prototyping models, this role is much broader one. 

This way I think Data Scientist is a very important and crucial role having a lot of responsibility to get/maintain organization on right and successful path.




What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

Major Duties : As per my exploration in Data Science field, I believe major duties for Data Scientist is to gather data from multiple sources and apply machine learning, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets , understand data from a business point of view and provide accurate predictions and insights that can be used to power critical business decisions. But there maybe additional duties for Data Scientist depending on need/requirements of organization for this role. 

Knowledge Areas : Data Scientist should gain critical skills in three departments: analytics, programming, and domain knowledge. 
People have tried to define data science for over a decade now, and the best way to answer the question is via a Venn diagram. Created by Hugh Conway in 2010, this Venn diagram consists of three circles: math and statistics, subject expertise (knowledge about the domain to abstract and calculate), and hacking skills. Essentially if you can do all three, you are already highly knowledgeable in the field of data science.

	 

As per Drew Harry, the director of data science at Twitch, data science team brings together three things: statistics, programming, and product knowledge. Completely agree with this. 
Without an understanding of how people are using the product, and what the company goals are, the data analysis can get lost in translation. So a data scientist’s job to have all the things in his/her head all at once, so when someone comes to the department with a problem that isn’t very well defined, they know what data they have at hand to answer the question.



What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

Data Science and Statistics are both different and complementary fields. Statisticians need to understand the modeling and structure of data, while data scientists need to understand applied statistics. 
Although data scientists and statisticians tend to gather information for similar purposes, their means of data collection are quite different. Data scientists spend a lot of time with tasks like large-scale data ingest, data cleansing and transformation where as statisticians still rely on more traditional and smaller scale methods of data collection, such as surveys, polls, and experiments. Data Scientists focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy. Where as Statisticians starts with simple model where  data is verified if its consistent with the assumptions of the model and focuses on all model assumptions are verified and no assumptions are violated.
In simple words we can say that data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. 
Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. Statisticians have knowledge in depth for concepts like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals, standard errors, p-values, hypothesis testing, and the proverbial argument between the “frequentists” and “Bayesians.”
There are many cases where a data scientist would not have a clue what to do with certain data sets without help from someone with a background in statistics. At the same time, if a statistician was handed a high-dimensionality data set with multiple billion rows and thousands of predictor variables, they’d be hard pressed to set-up the data for analysis without consulting a data scientist. 
Ultimately, the two disciplines need to find some common ground.

The fields differ in modeling processes, the size of data consumed, the types of problems studied, the academic background of the people in the field, and the terminology used. At the same time, the fields are closely related in the sense that both data science and statistics aim to extract knowledge from data.
Its saying that, maybe in future, data science and statistics fields likely will converge to a common end-point. Statisticians will pick up on skills like implementing algorithms that learn from data and provide predictions and actions and data scientists will pick up on statistical science (sampling, experimental design, confidence intervals, p-values, etc.).  So the boundary between data scientists and statisticians will eventually blur.


How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

 “A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”
As a statistics degree, I’ll be aware of statistics theories/concepts. Data Scientists also need to have basic knowledge of statistics(not same as statistician though). So I believe I’ll be in relation of both the fields, more on statistics and less on data science. 

Based on ST558, which is more based on programming, will prepare statistics students for programming background which can be used for the statistical analysis. 
I want to learn additional data scientist concepts when I’ll be finishing with statistics degree. For e.g. time series, neural network, machine learning,…
Eventually, I see myself as Statistician having knowledge of Statistics + Data Scientist (with the knowledge of concepts like modeling, structuring data)
