# Bike Sharing Analysis Project
Project II is the analysis of Bike Sharing Data of Washington DC, for 2011 and 2012 and automate reports per each day of the week using predictive models. 
A bike rental business rents out bikes for shorter period of time. Traveller can rent bike from one bike station and return to the other station. It is very useful system in the busy cities as well. 
So _Bike Sharing System_ plays important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. This is very excited topic to do some analysis of utilization of bikes through bike renting system. 


# Process For Bike Sharing Analysis :
1) Setup Github Repository to use between the team members and provide access

2) For Data, we applied below process.
- Analyse the Data
- Come up with the required list of variables
- filter data for weekday 
- Remove missing values  
- Convert specific variables as factor

3) Visualization of data and analysis based on plots
- Visualization of data done by creating plots as below.
- Scatter plot of temp with cnt
Scatter plot of atemp with cnt
- Boxplot of cnt by season
- Boxplot of cnt by weathersit
- BarPlot of cnt by year
- Bar of registered by year
- Bar of casual by year
- Scatter plot of hum with cnt
- Scatter plot of windspeed with cnt

4) Compute summary statistics for some of the variables like contingency tables. 

5) Used predicted models like multiple linear regression, random forest and boosted tree

6) Created reports for each day of the week

7) Comparision of the models and declaration of winner.


# what would you do differently? 
In addition to this study, I would like to go into deep and analyse utilization of bikes based on population and location of the city/town/states and how the utilization varies based on population.


# what was the most difficult part for you?
The difficult part of this project is creating esemble models with the variables which turns out to be only one factor for specific days. Data scientist needs to play with bigdata, use many variables and should be carefully handle such situations in their analysis. Based on it, they need to generate reports to provide proper analysis.  


# what are your big take-aways from this project?
I feel this project has covered most of the techniques we learned till now. So this is a good approach to get idea to solve real world issues or provide detail analysis on new upcoming technologies. So I don't think anything I can take-away from this project.
