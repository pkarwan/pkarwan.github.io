**If anything change in thought from first blog about data scientist is and what they do**  <br />
Based on my first blog 'Data Science and Statistics', I see the thought I mentioned earlier is the same. There is no change in point of view for data scientist. Earlier was just a thought/knowledge based on the blogs which I read. But now, I can confirm thoese thoughts are correct from my first blog after attempting ST558 Course and attempting data scientist projects covered in the course.<br />
*"Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and statistical methods (behind the scene) to find trends and manage data. Data scientists focus on data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. Analyze the data and provide right model is the main task for Data Scientist. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations. Data Scientist helps to understand the business based on data analysis and this helps companies to gain more profit , cost cutting/investments where ever necessary and run company/business more efficiently. A data scientistâ€™s work typically involves making sense of messy, unstructured data, from multiple types of sources. Data Scientist helps in making critical business decisions based on right predictions. Since data scientists focus on analyzing data, providing business insights, and prototyping models, this role is much broader one."*  <br />




 <br />**Current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - continuing to use R going forward?  Why or why not?** <br />
I'll definately continue to use R going forward. 
R is developed for statistical computing and graphics and it provides all the statistical functionalities which require for data scientist. It is highly extensible and provides statisical and graphical techniques like linear/non-linear modelling, clustering, classification, timeseries,... R is great for in-depth statisical analysis. R is a high quality reporting tool. It is useful to develop high quality graphs, charts by using ggplot2, rcharts, ggvis.

 <br />Another thought that I observed job requirements need not only R but python or other languages too. So I may be using other languages as well in addition to R language.




<br /> <br />**Things going to do differently in practice now**
Since I had ST558 course, I would like to pickup any datasets from kaggle or google and play around it like run some EDAs and get to some conclusions, create reports, make shiny app, get more clarity on docker/containers using R. 

<br />Also I'll look for any opportunities to get hands on experiance on R to work with realtime data as a project work.
