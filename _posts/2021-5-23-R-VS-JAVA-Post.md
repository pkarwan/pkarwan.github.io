<br /><br />This is a great topic. I have used many languages earlier including JAVA and now I'm excited to learn R. <br/>

# I would like to discuss about JAVA Vs R. 

**"Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology".**I like the defination for JAVA stated on [JAVA Tutorial]("https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial"). It gives us clear idea about JAVA. It is a scalable, powerful and portable language. JAVA is a platform independent language which is very useful functionality. So saying for JAVA is "write once, run anywhere". We find JAVA in almost many large scaled systems. It is class-based programming language having many useful core concepts like multithreading, error handling, abstraction, polymorphism,... and many more. _But when it comes to detailed statistical analysis, statistian's choice is R._ <br/>
**R is developed for statistical computing and graphics.** It is highly extensible and provides statisical and graphical techniques like linear/non-linear modelling, clustering, classification, timeseries,... R is great for in-depth statisical analysis. It is supported by CRAN repository which includes many packages which helps to perform statisical analysis and visualization. It is great for data operations like modelling, wrangling, transform. R is a high quality reporting tool. It is useful to develop high quality graphs, charts by using ggplot2, rcharts, ggvis. <br/>
Even though JAVA and R are in the same category, Language, the serving purpose for both languages is different and each language is best in its own category. So I feel like **comparing R and JAVA is like comparing apple and orange.** <br/><br />

# Functionality you like about R: <br/>
Even though I just started to learn R, I noticed some differences in other language and R. I like that programmer can use keywords like sd, mean as variable as well as function becuase R identifies based on paranthesis and treat it as variable or function. R recognises the datatype as integer, character.  Also infix is another cool feature which can be very useful. Libraries like dplyr, tidyverse provides ready functions to use which runs many steps in the background and also in a short time. R includes many datasets that can be used while learning/playing around R. I like the functionality as implicit coercion. R coerce data from less flexible to more flexible datatype. If-else runs condition on vector elements collectively which is very useful. I love the RMarkdown which is  a nice tool to use to run chunk of code or write notes/comments, graph visualization. <br/>

# Parts you miss about your other language? <br/>
Sometimes I confuse while using logical operators - and/or (& / |) in the if-else function. In other languages, its double (&&, ||) which maps only one to one element where as its single in R which is additional feature to map multiple elements at once. If R is learner's fist language, maybe this is not the case. <br/>

# R a difficult language to learn? <br/>
Based on difficulty to learn R language, I would give _3 out of 10_. R provides many packages, libraries, functions, examples to use functions and **Help is always available**. So its easy and interesting to learn. <br/>
